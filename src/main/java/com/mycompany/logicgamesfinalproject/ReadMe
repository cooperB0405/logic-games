Welcome to my Logic Games Project
the start file is the WelcomeWin.java
Here you will be prompted to input a username
then through the GameSelectWin.java you can choose between 
games and viewing your stats
The games are prompted after selecting a difficulty in the 
DifficultyLevel.java
after that the GameWin.java and GameBoard.java will allow you 
to play your selected game
On the other hand UserStatsWin.java will show you 
your career games played and won

Enjoy!
